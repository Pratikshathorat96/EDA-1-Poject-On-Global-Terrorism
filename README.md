# EDA-1-Poject-On-Global-Terrorism
To the promotion and protection of human rights As a security/defence analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism and finding weapons types used by terrorist.Also finding most active terrorist groups. What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?
Why I choose this project
I Choose this project to Examine a variety of theoretical and empirical materials needed for analysing pressing questions, relating to war, security and peace.To gain a solid understanding of contemporary security challenges, from environmental degradation to gender based insecurity, and the ability to analyse these issues surrounding security and terrorism.

What is Terrorism
The term "Terrorism" is derived from Latin word "Terror", whic rerfers to "great fear". The word "Terrorism" was first used during French Revolution in the yera 1795. The term was used to refer to intentional or planned use of brutality and violence to create an environment of fright, panic, distress and fear in general public with the sole purpose of establishing a certain political or social narrative. In todays world terrorism is used by different parties in different perspective under different circumstances. Though UN Security Council recognises Terrorism as a threat to pease and security, but fails to define terrorism in any of it resolutions and urges member countries to define Terrorism in their respective national law. Acoordingly different countries define Terrorism & Terrorist differently in their Laws.

How Do Countries Define Terrorism?
US Government/FBI defines and classifies terrorism as below:

International Terrorism:
Violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups who are inspired by, or associated with , designated foreign terrorist organizations or nations(state-sponsored). We have used Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to represent our insights meaningfully and draw conclusions.

Through this project we aim to analyse the following:

What the hot zones of terrorism? What causes the strained relationship between countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan? How dreadful were the Boko Harams in Nigeria? How safe id Mumbai after 26/11/2008? Study the patterns of Naxalism in the Indian states. What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?

This global Terrorism dataset has the record of attacks in between 1970 to 2017

Lets describe few of the columns which we have considered for our analysis.

In this Global Terrorisim dataset the column iyear represents the year of attack in between 1970-2017, imonth represents the month of the attack & idate represents the day of the terrorist attacks in world wide.

The column country is the country code of the perticular county and the column country_txt shows the corresponding country name.

The column region shows the region code of the targetted region and the column region_txt shows the corresponding region name.

The column provstate shows the impacted state of the counry, city shows the list of cities of the state which have under attack by the terrorist.

Then we have the columns latitude and longitude containing data of the geographical coordinates of the attacks. The column vicinity shows the vicinity of the attacks.

The column location shows the location of the attacks or the place where the terrorists attacked , and the column summary briefs the date of the attack, type of the attack , number of terrorists, type of weapons used, targets and the damages.

The column alternative contains data of the no. of alternative attacks of the the day are made in the terrorist attacks , & the column alternative_txt that shows the type of alternatve attacks in the perticular day in which the terrorist are attacked.

The column success has either 0 or 1 showing success or failure of the attack , and the column sucide contains number of terrorist who died if it was a suicide attack.

Then we have the columns attacktype1 , attacktype2 , attacktype3 which show the code of type of the attack .The column attacktype1_txt shows the text corresponding to the attack type(Assassination,Hostage Taking/Kidnapping,Bombing/Explosion..etc.)

The columns targtype1 shows the code for the type of targets, and the column targtype1_txt shows the text correspoding to targtype1.

The column gname shows the name of the terrorist outfit. The column motive is to show the motive behind the attack.

The column individual shows whether the terrorist carried out the attack in a team or a group.

The columns weaptype1 , weaptype2 ,weaptype3 , weapsubtype1 , weaptype2 , weaptype3 are for the weapon types used in the terrorist attacks, and the columns weaptype1_txt , weaptype2_txt , weaptype3_txt , weapsubtype1_txt , weapsubtype2_txt , weapsubtype3_txt are for the corresponding name of the weapon used (Gasoline or Alcohol,Explosives,Incendiary,Pipe Bombetc.) The column weapdetail provides additional details of the weapon used

The columns ransom,ransompaid contain the randsome amount demand(if any) and how much the authorith have paid(if any).

We as a team believe that meaningful dialogues,inclusive state policies,addressing problems at the root cause can protect us all from the cowardly and ghastly practice of terror mongering called TERRORISM. We as future data scientists and analysts have tried to understand the underlying causes and impacts of these unhumanly acts
